# refer-protocol
REFER PROTOCOL is an on-chain referral system built on EVM-compatible blockchains, designed to create and manage web-of-trust communities. It provides mechanisms for mapping and authenticating referrals, creating dependency trees, and implementing slashing mechanisms to monitor and govern web-of-trust-based systems.
