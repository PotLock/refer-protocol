# REFER PROTOCOL Overview

Let's discover **REFER PROTOCOL in less than 5 minutes**.

## Overview

REFER PROTOCOL is an on-chain referral system built on EVM-compatible blockchains, designed to create and manage web-of-trust communities. It provides mechanisms for mapping and authenticating referrals, creating dependency trees, and implementing slashing mechanisms to monitor and govern web-of-trust-based systems.

### Key Features:

1. **On-chain Referral Tracking**: Map and authenticate referrals directly on the blockchain.
2. **Dependency Trees**: Create and manage hierarchical referral structures.
3. **Slashing Mechanism**: Implement penalties for violating community rules or bringing in unwanted members.
4. **Customizable Parameters**: Allows deployers to set specific rules for their referral programs.
5. **Multi-level Rewards**: Incentivize not just direct referrers but also those higher up in the dependency tree.
6. **Web-of-Trust Authentication**: Use the referral system as a basis for proof-of-personhood or access control.

## Problem Statement

REFER PROTOCOL addresses several key issues in the Web3 ecosystem:

1. **Attribution and Incentives**: Current systems lack the ability to attribute and incentivize community growth effectively.
2. **Sybil Attack Prevention**: Existing smart contracts are vulnerable to Sybil attacks due to weak identity verification.
3. **Limited Referral Rewards**: Most referral systems only reward direct referrers, missing opportunities to incentivize early adopters.
4. **Trust Network Challenges**: Building and maintaining trust networks in decentralized environments is complex.

## Use Cases

- Web-of-trust communities
- Sybil attack prevention in smart contracts
- Programmatic access control based on trust networks
- Multi-level marketing (MLM) structures in Web3
- Decentralized identity verification

## Getting Started

To start using REFER PROTOCOL, you'll need to:

1. Set up Solidity for smart contract development
2. Build on Base for contract deployment
3. Utilize the GraphQL API via api.referprotocol.com (production) or dev.api.referprotocol.com (development)

Detailed setup instructions and API documentation will be provided in the following sections.
